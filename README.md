# dedsec-screen-mockup

Just an animated mockup of a watch dogs legion tech screen.  An exercise in making and animating SVG images and using css for animations, vs js or svg, as much as possible.  Next up: adding graffiti paint effects.

[See in action:](https://kellycode.github.io/dedsec-screen-mockup/)

It's just a tech screen look, doesn't do anything.
